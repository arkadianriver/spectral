We're taking a break from our normally scheduled programming on Election Day, and we want to encourage you to GO VOTE. We don't care who you vote for, so long as you do!

While we're on the subject of the polls, [we have a short survey for you to take while you're waiting in line to cast your vote](https://goo.gl/forms/9RidB7N7mQvPxz7G2).

If the line is even longer than our quick poll, then take the time to mark your calendars for two dates:

**November 29: Fifth Tuesday;** We'll have a Beer Summit at a location to be announced. Stay tuned.

**December 13: The Austin Web Bash, or #AWBASH**, holiday party is back! Every year, Refresh Austin hosts the  to bring Austin's web and tech meetups together under one roof to celebrate the end of the year. If you help [run a meetup that you want to participate](mailto:contact@refreshaustin.org) or you're with a [company that wants to sponsor](sponsor@refreshaustin.org), then let us know.
