excerpt: Our yearly SXSW get together!

It's back: Your favorite SXSW party with no free drinks, no mandatory RSVPs, and no badge required! That's right, it's our eighth annual pre-SXSW lunch at B.D. Riley's.  

Drop in for a pint. Or stay for a bite, and hang out for a while.

Everyone is welcome. This is a casual come-and-go-as-you-please lunchtime event. Some appetizers will be provided for the group, but youâ€™ll need to pick up your own tab--or even buy a round for your new friends.

Note that this meetup is during the day--and not on our typical second Tuesday. We'll be back to our regularly scheduled programming in April.
