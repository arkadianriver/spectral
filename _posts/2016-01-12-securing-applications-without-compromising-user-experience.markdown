#Securing Applications Without Compromising User Experience

**PLEASE NOTE THAT WE'RE MEETING AT OPEN SOURCE COWORKING THIS MONTH AND NOT BUFFALO BILLIARD'S!**

Securing Applications Without Compromising User Experience

Software is typically developed with the end user in mind. As software developers, we go to great lengths to ensure that users can have a seamless experience. However, allowing users to conveniently access their application allows attackers the opportunity to attack users with just as much ease. The eternal struggle that designers and developers face is striking a balance in design and security in order to not compromise the user but optimize his/her satisfaction. This talk will explore some practical strategies that can be implemented in order to improve the security posture of most applications without compromising on the user experience.
