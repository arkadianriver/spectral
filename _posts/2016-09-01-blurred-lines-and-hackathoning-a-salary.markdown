BLURRED LINES
Kyle Fiedler ([@kylefiedler](http://twitter.com/kylefiedler))

Should designers code? Should they generalize or specialize? As a community we constantly reiterate these same arguments. What makes a great team is when each memberâ€™s lines of responsibility blurs into that of others. At thoughtbot, designers have a wide range of responsibilities from business strategy to graphic design, to implementing a great user experience in the app. Kyle discusses why this has been successful for their teams and how designer and developer lines blur together at thoughtbot.

HACKATHONING A SALARY
Hannah Oppenheimer ([@opihana](http://twitter.com/opihana))

Get rich quick! Or not. Either way, participating in a hackathon can be a rewarding (and weird) experience. I was lucky enough to win a few hackathons, earn $60,000 doing it, and even got a real job out of it. I'll tell you what my teams did well, what we failed miserably on, and how it actually helped us become better developers and designers in a startup environment.
